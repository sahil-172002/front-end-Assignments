- **Task:** Create a page that displays detailed information based on dynamic route parameters (e.g., user profile).
- **Hint:** Use URL parameters with React Router to fetch and display dynamic content.
- **Objective:** Learn how to handle dynamic routing and parameter-based data fetching.

### Assignment 9: Responsive Design
- **Task:** Ensure your React application is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
- **Hint:** Use CSS media queries and responsive design principles to make your app mobile-friendly.
- **Objective:** Understand how to make a React application responsive.

### Assignment 10: Deployment
- **Task:** Deploy your React application to a cloud platform like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.
- **Hint:** Follow the platform’s deployment instructions and configure build settings.
- **Objective:** Gain experience in deploying a React application to a live environment.
